learningObjectives:
  - Reflect on the combination of useContext and useReducer for complex state
    management.
hints:
  - Consider the structure of useContext for context, and how useReducer
    functions similar to Redux.

              useReducer to handle complex state scenarios in a React app?

            \    Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to
            the expected answer: Expect mentions of managing global state with
            useContext and improving state updates with useReducer's reducer
            function. Both are used for making state management efficient and
            scalable in complex applications..

            \    # Assessment Criteria

            \    - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a
            clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the
            expected answer.

            \    - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.

            \    - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the
            answer rather than exact wording.

            \ \ 

            \    # Response Guidelines:

            \    - If the user's answer is correct or shows
            sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'.

            \      - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.

            \    - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.

            \      - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.

            \      - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic
            and supportive.

            \ \ 

            \    # Tone and Style:

            \    - Use friendly and encouraging language.

            \    - Be empathetic to the user's learning process.

            \    - Focus on helping the user learn and understand
            the material.
